# AtMoDat_CVs

This repository contains lists of mandatory/required, recommended and optional global attributes and CVs for some of them. They are stored in JSON files. The structure is the same as of the [CMIP6_CVs](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/CMIP6_CVs/).

# Open Questions:

* `frequency`: also include `frequency_units` or assume same unit as `time` variable?
* `geospatial_*_resolution`: currently, `*` can be `lon` or `lat`; however, `x` and `y` might also be reasonable alternatives; in the later case, we needed units;
